    "text": " Welcome back to another episode of Chai Aur Kod. This week we will be talking about a series which is a series of HTML. I took a break for a few days because I had worked loads and worked pressure. So I thought I would tell you about the holidays. I posted a lot of videos but now we are starting the series. You can expect a lot of videos frequently and daily. Let's start the series of HTML. We have covered a lot of topics and today we will be talking about tables. We will write a little code about tables. I will tell you about some behind the scenes details and how the world has changed and is happening towards tables. Let's start with a simple file. It is called tables.html. We have learnt a lot of things. We can write fast code. We can type an exclamation and hit it. There are some other shortcuts here like you can write HTML and hit it. Or you can write HTML colon 5 and hit it. There are many ways. I like exclamation and tab. Let's talk about tables. First we will change the document to table. I used to find the way to write tables boring when we didn't have an emitter. We had to write everything manually in a text editor. Now we have an emitter in the tables. We will see some shortcuts that will help us create tables. Let's see the shortcut first. The way to see the shortcut is first we will go to the emitter. Simply google at service. Google.com And here we see emitter, table, shortcut. When you see table shortcuts in the emitter, especially when you find them in cheat sheet, I will search table. These are some of the shortcuts of the table. Let's zoom in. In the table you can write dot row as many times as you want. These are the shortcuts of CSS. We don't want these shortcuts. Let's go to the other shortcut. And here. There are some other shortcuts here. These are the shortcuts of table. I think table plus. This is a shortcut. You can write table plus. It is an alias to create rows and data in your table. This is the most important and easy shortcut. Many people use it. If you find it a little tough, I will also tell you the easy shortcut. First we will use table plus. And as soon as you hit the tab, you will notice that there is nothing in the VS code. This is the most surprising thing. There is nothing in the table. These are shortcuts when you manually install. Although there are many shortcuts like map plus. These are all shortcuts here. But the way to install and use them is a little different. Like I just told you, there are HTML colon 5. These are all shortcuts. Some shortcuts work, some don't. We can't rely on them and we can't depend on them. For example, in the table, you have only one shortcut. I will write colon plus and you will see that there is nothing. Look at this. We will give you these shortcuts. First you write table. You can add whatever you want to add in the table after typing with this arrow key. I will make an example table and show you. After that, things will be a little easier. First, we will start with table. Table comes in rows of tables. There will be more things. We will tell you that too. But first table rows will come. There are many rows in a table. With this, I will give you a small tip. Our brain is trained from the beginning by reading books. The tabular structure data is still very challenging to convert it into a mobile. We will talk about it later. But remember that our brain is trained to look left to right. And that is what the majority of screens do. The story is different in the mobile. We will talk about that too. But in the table, as you write T-R, look at the tab, a table tag was created and a table row tag was created. But this is not our goal. We want to go deeper in this. You have created table row. You need TH, that is table heading. Yes, it is a very easy shortcut. It is not that difficult. How many should I need? I need three. I will multiply it by three. If I gave you a direct shortcut, it would seem difficult to memorize it. But this shortcut will help us to make a list and learn to make a lot of navigation bars. It will look great. You see table heading into three. This is giving you a sample output. That your table will look like this. Table row will look like this. You will also see three headings. We can go further in this too. We can fill the sample data too. But I think it is not right for now. So let's hit tab and our table heading is here. Now I explained it to you. So it took a little more time. Otherwise, you can see how easily we can help it through the emitter. Take a table, give a table row, give me a table heading, multiply it by three or four, whatever you want. Your work is done. Now the best thing is, after writing, I will hit tab. I will automatically go into second table heading. So here we write simply country. After that we write country code. After that we write email. Save and see how it looks. So let's click right. Let's open with live server. So country code, country email. We didn't expect such a table. We thought it would be a default table. It doesn't work like this. There will be a little work of CSS here. Which we will do. But first let's fill the data. Now I will give you an easy shortcut. Whenever you make a table row like this, whenever it is done, collapse it. Use editors. Because editors are there to reduce the code and the bugs of writing. Now we need more table rows. And we need the same. So let's do it again. We need table row. In this, last time we took the T-H, which was the table heading. Now we need T-D, that is, table data. And again, if you take T-H, then nothing will happen. HTML will negate it again. But the problem is, when you have a search engine on Google, then it won't know which part to search like heading and which part to serve the user and which part to serve the data. You must have seen that by default, you search some data and Google directly lists it. Those who write good HTML, they have a good page. So we need table row, table data and again we take 3 data. So here we take 3 data. Multiply by 3. We took this. Now I will give you another shortcut with this. Because we have this much data. We will write country code here. Of course, this is the thing. We will write India first. Then IN, our country code. And then email. So India at the rate. Google.com. So we have written this. And we will go and see. This is how it looks. Something doesn't look good. It will look good now. But now an easy shortcut, which everyone should know. Select all of them. And press the Alt key. Or if you are on Mac, then the Option key. Press the Shift key with it. And down arrow. The moment you press it, you can make the copy of that code. The copies you want, you can make the copies. Similarly, we will learn to write fast code. As you are on the channel, keep subscribing. I will keep telling you more shortcuts. So you can write speedy code. Now what we will do? Simply go to the other country instead of India. USA. And write its full name. United States. America. And write its country code. USA. In caps. And we will use the small one here. USA. After that, we will use Japan. And write its country code here. JP. And we will make its email too. JP. And we need one more country. So we will use China. And... CN. CN. I don't remember. Whatever it is, you understood it. CN at google.com. Now as we save it, we have quickly made the table data. But this table doesn't look so good. Now I will tell you. This table looks like this. Now we can see that this table is divided into three parts. One part, two part and three part. When we used to make websites in the early days, we used to do the same. We used to give the table the width and height of the whole screen. After that, we used to add the navigation bar in the first row. We used to add the logo in the left one. We used to add the buttons in the right one. And we used to make websites in the same way. This approach was there when people were not so cautious about using browsers. If there was a single desktop, we would have to make the entire website in that. It would work easily. It doesn't work now. There are many screen variants. There are many screen sizes. There are mobile sizes too. So the table approach is not right now. If you want to give the structure of the whole website. We will learn the flex box, ordering and many other things where we can do this. That's enough for now. But we make it a little better and more beautiful. To make it better and more beautiful, we need to take a little touch of CSS. We can stop the video here. But we will go a little further about it. Definitely when we read the tables in CSS, we will go further in depth. But at least it is our job to make it beautiful. The CSS we will write is not a difficult CSS. We will simply go under the title. Of course, we will be under the title. First of all, write style and hit tab. So we have the style tag. Now our styling can be in this file instead of being in a completely different CSS file. We will read more approaches in the future. Tailwind and everything will be on the channel. That's it. So now we will target the table. In this way, you target an element. And in curly braces, you write all its styling. So first of all, we write width. We give it width 100%. And what will happen if we give it width 100% The table is completely scattered on the screen. Okay, our work is done. After that, we have many more borders here. I will write one more thing, which will not happen. But we will write it anyway. Which is border collapse. What do we do in this? We write collapse. When we read CSS, we will see more. But we are still seeing it. Nothing is happening. We want to do border collapse. I will come back to this and tell you more details. Just wait for a minute. Now we have data in the table. And we have heading in the table. I want to target both of them together. Let's see what happens. First and foremost, to give the table a look, we have to give it border property. Border property is a little difficult. It is not difficult, it is lengthy. We will go into more details in CSS. Now we just say, Give me a border of 1 pixel, which is solid. And we will have to give it color. So we will take black. We will take more later. So in this way, we can see a little tabular structure. That the table is like this. You can give more text line property in the table. That I want it all on the text center. You can do that too if you want. But that is all for now. Now I want to add one more property here. Which is padding. So we add padding here. Not auto, we will add padding manually. So we give padding. We give 10 pixel. It is an arbitrary number. You can take any number. So it is okay. We can see a little tabular structure. As much as we want. And the table is coming down. Now I will add one more property here. And you will see when we read CSS, We will go about other selectors like this. So we will read one special part here. So what we will do here? I want to select the table row. Okay. So I want to select the table row. And give it a background color. My favorite color is here. Which is hash 41414. 3 is also here. 313131. All these colors look better on me. This is a little dark gray. If you go on 313131, it is a little light gray. So 313131. Just like you will go in more detail. If you remember some color codes, You don't have to remember. Now I saw one thing. The color of the text of this table will be white. So it will be better. So we go here and white it. For white, it is FFF. It is enough to write 3. It should be 6. But okay. Okay. Now what I will do? I will not teach you a small thing. I will discuss a little more details about tables. What we will do? We will take our Enneth child. And you can write directly here that you want even or odd. And that even value will be highlighted. But we are seeing now that even value is highlighted. But the country, the colors, after writing the text, It has gone away from us. So what can we do with this color? Let's light this background color a little. So that we can see the text in black. And also get a little color gradient. There are many properties in CSS. Which we will learn later. But for now, it is so fine. So we saw, we made a very basic table. I will give you a small summary in between lecture. We had table heading. And then table came here. Now you are seeing table heading automatically becomes a little bold. Which is the effect of browser. It is not of my CSS. And all other values are there. Even if a browser or Google search engine will come to search, He knows what is heading and what is its data. But not only this. There are few more properties in the table. And as we saw that there are borders. You can see all the borders. Like I show you in another property. What happens if I don't collapse this border. I saved it and saw here. So we saw that there is a border of the table itself. That is why I had collapsed that border first. Otherwise it would have come in this look. And there is an individual cell of that too. An additional property has come here. Additional border has come here. That is why I had collapsed the border here. Collapse means don't show that border. We saved it. See, it is a little tabular look. So in the border, the part in the table is mostly enhanced through CSS. So we will see how it can be. I will show you some other properties here. Which many people use. What happens many times. In the table, you have this style with 100%. See, there is a lot of way to write style. You can write style by targeting it separately. You can give inline styling. Like this table, it looks fine. But what many people do is go inside this table. And specially many pre-built components are given like this. Width. The style is tagged here. And then the width is given directly here. 100% width. Okay, I want 100% width. The width of the page. Then the same effect came. Same look came. So don't worry. If you have a table somewhere that you want to copy paste. You have given styling there. There are many ways of styling. We will read them in detail. Okay. So this is your basics. Now I will tell you one more thing. It is not necessary that you have to write tables like this. There are many ways to write tables. And it is not necessary that the heading of the table or top row. The whole table heading comes there. Many times our table can be designed like this. Where we need the top to bottom heading. So it can be designed like this. So I will show you a small example of a code here. Okay. So I have made a new table for you. And yes, this magic video editing will continue so that you don't waste your time. You can understand what I want to explain to you quickly. So here I have made another new table. Yes, I will show you the code of this too. So here I have given the list of countries on the left side of the country. India, Japan. And similarly I have written a code and JP, whatever is its code. So here you can see there is no difference. I have made a simple table. You need rows in it. So I have given table heading in every column. That's it. Wherever you write the T H, it will become a table heading. Now you need top to bottom or left to right. The way you want it, it happens the same way. So there are many ways to make tables. In which you want. And there are cells of the table. Like we have seen one cell here. You can target the cells as much as you want. So we are seeing one cell here. It is very important to know the words of the cells. What is a cell? What is a table? What is a row? So the row is complete. India in India at the rate google.com. This is a whole row. The column we have is the country, India, USA, Japan. This is a whole column. And the unit inside it is our cell. When you target in CSS, you will know what you are targeting. On its basis you will know what is it, how detailed are these things. Now there is one more thing in it. I will tell you in a short way, how we discuss detailed adjustments. So another word we have is call span. And in the same way, it is your column span and your row span. I will show you a small example by coding. After that you will understand a lot. Now we will see here. What we will do is, we will add this property in the TH. Now tell me, that TH is an element, and from here to here, it is an element. So what will we say about this? Tell me in the comment section. We had discussed a lot about tag name, attribute, so what will I say about this call span? Tell me in the comment section. So as soon as you write call span, I will write here 2. You can write any value. You will see once you have done practical. As soon as I have saved, notice how much the country is getting called span. See, from the bottom table, you will know. The code is here, IN is here, and the entire space is taking the country alone. So the more you normally give the value, give the column to 2 columns, and give it to me alone. So you can write 3 as well. So what will happen now? The lower the value, the more value you get, the more you will get it alone. So you can give more value as well. It is not necessary that it is 3, you can give 5 as well. So that space will increase a little, but we will not know until we add more values. So these are the things that we need. You must have seen a time table in your childhood, where lunch breaks, sometimes the value of lunch is more, sometimes it is less. Sometimes two lectures are made and one lecture is made. So in the same way, tables were made. So this is your call span. Similarly, we have another span here. You can research about it. Row span. Now I will take you into a little detail on documentation, because if you have not read the documentation, then what did you learn? So let's go inside the table and see the shortcuts of MDN. MDN HTML. So let's go here as well. So you will see that the attributes here are not that much. Attributes like background colors, borders, cell padding, all these are there. As I told you, cell, cell spacing. We do not need to look at frames because these are not that many examples. But here they have given some examples. Go a little and read them. So there are many examples like call group, column, so we can see them in this way. Let's take a small example of this. Let's see what value the call group adds to us. So call group is a very easy topic. You can give a little detail about it. So let's read about it. The first thing you should know about it is that you do not use it much. You mostly use things like this through CSS. But still, let's take a little detail example. So this is our first table. And I want to make this first table a country and country code. I will make a group of these two columns. So let's see how we do it. Although, it does not make much sense to do it this way. You will also see that this could have been done through CSS. But it is okay. We will add one property here. So first of all, first of all, make a call group of this tag. After that, as soon as we go inside this tag, we can select columns. So what we have done is that give call property here. And again, this call here, C-O-L column, this is a self-closing tag. So it will be better to write it this way. Now you want to know how much you need to span. You need two properties. How many columns do you need? For example, one needs two. Our target is two now. So we write two. If there were three or four columns, we would have made four columns. After that, we need to know if you want to put a style in it. Because look, why do you want to put a style? You don't need to put a style. As soon as you go here, these two columns have become a group. But how do I know if it has become a group or I can use it. That is why we can put a style property or any other property or any other click event that we want to put here. The easiest thing to do is the background colors. So what do we do here? A background dash color. And we give it some color here. So we suggest that some color like this that can be easily used. Although I don't use colors like this. But okay, let's use it this time. So we saw that these two columns were selected together. That's why the property was applied to both. So in this way, we can select more things. But the way to unite columns like this is not so much implemented. The browsers have also dropped the support of Dhiridiresk. You will see that there will be more documentation here. So we will tell you that there is no work to do to sort the tables like this. We have an additional JavaScript that we can do. But we can't go to JavaScript right now. So this is enough for our table. You don't need to go too much. I will give you a small assignment. You will see that there is also T-foot. So text area and all this you don't need to read. There are many properties in the table. Some have been discarded. Those who have dustbin icons. Means now they don't need to work. You don't need to read everything. You don't need to see everything. You just need to see one T-foot. T-foot is simply the footer of the table. And you just need to study this example. What is it? We have seen that no matter how much T-body is there. You don't need to see all this. Now the implementation of tables has become a little easier. You just need to see what are the headers of the tables. What are rows. That's it. The majority of the elements that we have made are made in the same way. You can see T-foot for knowledge. But it is not necessary. Okay. So this is our detailed understanding of tables.
