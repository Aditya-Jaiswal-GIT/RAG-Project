    "text": " Welcome to the Chai and Kod episode of HTML series. In this video, we will simply see what are the other elements of HTML. HTML tags, elements, attributes and all of these. You don't need to make 500 videos in HTML. If you cover the basics and foundation of HTML, then it can be useful in some videos. In this video, we will increase the length so that we can focus on each topic. So, let's start without any delay. We are working on the same file. We have known what is the doc type, what are the document types, what are the HTML types. We will talk about these in a short time so that we can learn JavaScript or some other languages in the future. First of all, you should know that there are some keywords in HTML like HTML element, tags and attributes. The H1 you are seeing here is simply element. In element, only H1 is not there. Element means the starting tag of H1 is ABC's part, the ending tag of ABC's part and whatever you have written in it is all of it. So, from start to end, all of these are our HTML element. After that, the H1 you are seeing is our tag name. Now, there is not just this much tag name, we can add some other properties like for example, the title we add here. So, I will just write here, heading 1. And nothing happened with this, but the whole part you are seeing here is the entire HTML element. Yes, this is included in this. So, from start to end, it is the whole element. But the tags are still H1 here. And these are the properties we call attributes. So, keep in mind these things because when you go to JavaScript and learn to modify the HTML elements through JavaScript, the difference between these things is very important to know when elements are stored in our variable, when the data is stored in our variable, when its attribute is stored. JavaScript is very important. Now, let's talk a little bit about this, not much. First and foremost, the important part, I go to view here and I will wrap it up so that you can see everything together. Or, we will shrink it a little bit. Okay, the most important thing is that please don't forget to close any element. If it doesn't close, then keep it in self-closing. We saw this in the last video. If you don't do it, then there is no problem. But when you read the React or any other language, then we will see that this problem creates. You will also see that many web pages or examples are written in capital H1. You can write it, but I don't write it because HTML is not case sensitive. So, I prefer that everything is in lower case. And you need to know one thing more. You can nest in many elements. For example, here it is already nesting. There is an H1 tag in the body. You can also include other tags. Suppose you have written H2 tag, then you have written heading. After heading, you have to keep your two or three tags in a span. There is a kind of tag in the span. You can write it here. For example, two. When we use CSS later, it is very easy to target any element. So, it can be interlinked or intermixed. You just need to know this much about this topic. Now, let's talk about attributes. Attributes. For example, there are attributes of a person. He is tall, he is short. There are many headings and tags. You don't need to know all the attributes. We will discuss some attributes here. For example, we will get a new tag here. Anker tag. It is simply to open a new link. Here, you will see the by default attribute of this tag. Href. It means a reference. Hyperlink reference. Where should I go? On any other web page or website. This attribute is compulsory for this tag. Otherwise, this tag doesn't work. For example, I will write here Google. Google will come, but you can't go anywhere by clicking on it. Let's open this tag in a browser. I will just come here on extension. And I will enable it. Let's come here. Right click. Open with live server. And here. Let's open this. One second. Here is our tag. And here, we have Google. But, nothing happens by clicking on Google. Why doesn't this happen? Because we haven't filled the compulsory value of a tag. In many code projects, you will see that when you don't fill the value, it is simply a hash. The reference of this value is not going anywhere. I will fill it later or it doesn't have any value. If you want to fill the value, you can simply give the full resource here. Like HTTP s colon slash slash and google.com. But not this. Apart from this, there are many other references here. For example, in the A tag, we will read more references in detail. For example, let me show you one more shortcut of emitting. A and colon. You see, here is blank, link, mail, tell. There are different users. For example, I click on blank. So, this only adds a value. It is target underscore blank. There are many values here. For example, if you press control and space, you will get a suggestion in VS Code. That blank, parent, self or top. I don't know the meaning of all this. How does it work? For all this, I simply go to google. And A tag, MDN, the best resource. And as you go to Mozilla developer network, you will get to know all the things about anchor. Like attributes. So, how many attributes can be there? Like download an attribute. Href attribute, we have already heard. Href lang, here is another attribute. Ping is also an attribute. Referral policies is also an attribute. So, you are seeing, there are many attributes. Like we have seen here, target is an element. So, when we write self, the current browser context. In simple words, it only opens it in the same browser. When you write underscore blank, usually a new tab. So, open a new tab and open the website. Or whatever you have given the resource. Similarly, there are parents and top. Now, the most important thing is that we are on this channel. And in fact, whenever I teach people, I tell them that it is very important to go to documentation. Because any tutorial is fine, it will tell you about Href, A tags. But this is a sure thing, that something or the other will be missed. So, the most important thing is that we go to attributes. And here, see what attributes can be there in A tag. So, we have seen that download attribute can be there. Href attribute can be there. And ping attribute can be there. So, take some time and go to A tag. And learn here about all attributes. You don't need to know about properties, examples, and details. Whenever you have time, we will discuss about it. Now, your assignment is so simple that you can go to the tags that I have discussed. Click on the attributes and see what attributes are available to us. Now, this is the talk of A tag. We will discuss more about A tag in detail later on. But every element, every tag we have, has some compulsory attributes and some non compulsory. As we have seen, the title is non compulsory, it doesn't matter if it is written or not. But if you want the working of A tag, there are compulsory attributes. For example, A tag. So, it is enough to know this much. And also, as we will come to know more, we will read more details about them. When we will discuss images, we will see their compulsory attributes. Now, we will see an interesting thing here. As we have written heading and written heading 1 and heading. So, as you click on it and hover the mouse, you can see that heading 1 has come. So, the title is only for this. And when you come to these titles, you can modify them more through tooltips and through CSS. So, we have this much basic. Now, we will extend this page a little more. And let's start exploring our tags. So, first of all, our tags are heading. So, we will make a file named heading.html. We will run speed again. We hit the exclimate tab. We came here quickly. We have written heading inside the document. Now, what we will do here is, we will see all the types of headings and read their documentation. So, first of all, we came to h1. So, we have written heading 1. We saved it and we will open it. So, we will close it. It doesn't need to be opened. And command shift P, you might remember. And we will write live server. Live. So, show live server. So, our heading 1 has come. Now, first of all, we will read a shortcut about VS Code. Which is your option key, shift and the down arrow key. Press it. You have a duplicate value. We will read another shortcut here. Click here. Press the option key and press it. And click again. Now, you have two arrows. You can edit one year. This shortcut is necessary. So, we have heading 1 here. And now, we will bring heading 2. So, we have heading 2. So, we have 6 types of headings. H3. Heading 3. And then, we will come to H4. So, heading 4. And H5 too. Which is used very less. Because if your documentation is so abstract that you need so many headings, then you might need a new page. But still, it is necessary to write heading 6. So, heading 5. And then, H6. So, we have heading 6. Alright. So, we have heading 6. It is very small. Now, we will go here quickly. And we will read about the headings. You can find out about everything here. But you have to go here first. So, we went to the heading element. We saw that this is heading. Now, we will just look at its attributes. We can see that there are no more attributes here. There are no more values in it. We will look at the attributes. So, there are no more attributes. You can use the title attributes with everyone. So, it is common. But we saw that there is nothing more. So, it is simple. You don't need to take so much load on the headings. Because there are simple tags. Okay. After this, we have another type of heading. Or, the text that comes to write. It comes through the paragraph. Now, whenever you go and write in the paragraph, suppose this is a paragraph. So, it takes a lot of time to write. So, our focus, the attention that we have to learn about the text, is our missing. So, the best way to do this is to use the M.A.T. How? We will use the paragraph. After that, we will use the arrow. And we will write the lorem. Now, how many words do you need to write the lorem? Suppose I want 20 words. I will write 20 and hit the tab. And 20 words have come there. I go here to view and wrap it up. So that everyone can see me. So, my focus is to know how the paragraph tag works. Not to know what I want to write in it. Or, where I should copy and paste the text. So, it is very simple. We will learn about some tags in it, which we will use later. For example, whatever word is written, I don't know what it is written. After that, if I hit the line, I enter. I want everything in the new line. I save everything. So, it doesn't matter in HTML. So, I have some options here. The br tag, which breaks the line. Now, the line breaks here. But the ideal option is that, if you read the react, it will work. So, you write br slash. Put half of it. It will be better for you. And not only that, you can also draw a horizontal line on it. Like hr. And here, you can see a line comes here. So, HTML doesn't know about our line breaks. And this is a classic problem. You will read all the documentation of HTML, W3C, MDN, classic poem problem, which is called, how to solve the classic poem problem in the paragraph. There are two or three ways. I will tell you all. I don't know poems, but you still have to know all the details. So, here we add a paragraph. And, as we write, poem, oops, we write line 1. It will be better. Line 1, line 2, then comes line 3, and line 4. So, in this way, we write some poems. But as we can see, in HTML, we have written it, but it is not showing like poems. So, there are many options. How can you deal with it? First of all, I come here, and enter br tag. Oops, br tag. And here, line 1 came. Similarly, I come here, and add br tag. I add br tag. This is line 2. And here, I add br tag. And line 3 came. But this won't work. Because this is not a good way, if you have this type of text, or syntax. So, we remove it here. So, another tag, whenever you see, is the tag, pre tag. So, as we use pre tag, automatically, some browser default formatting happens. And as you want to write your text, it comes as it is. All the line spaces you use, or whatever you use. Now, along with this, I will tell you one more thing. Pre tag is not complex. As you enter pre tag, I go back to it. So, pre tags, I think we are in JavaScript. Let's go back to HTML. Here, pre tag. We have to search it again. This is the best way to write it on Google. Pre tag. Pre tag is not so complex. You will see, whatever syntax you want, star patterns, whatever you want to print, it is best to add it in pre tag. Now, when you see attributes, there are not many attributes, but still there are. For example, columns, width, wrap. We are seeing by default, that some columns have shifted here. If you want, how many columns you want, you can see it. There are some examples here. How you can use pre tags, by default. Apart from that, you can try it with some attributes, to see how many columns you want, how many widths you want. As I told you, any of you who are taking HTML training, learning, it is most important to go in documentation. Now, the most important thing is documentation. Notice here, you have an exclometry sign, and a delete sign, trashcan. So, here, it is written in front of these two, that it is deprecated. It means, it is not used now. Most browsers will not support it. Warning is that it is not standard. If you are using pre tags, then we could have given columns earlier, but now we cannot. We can give them, but most of the time, browsers do not support it. So, whenever you are reading, you get a history with it, that when, how, how it used to work, and you still know, so, this documentation is read like this. Yes, during the whole series, in fact, on the whole channel, I will tell you how documentation is read, because that is the only one you will make a real developer. Not tutorials, but keep watching and subscribe. So, here our pre tags have come. We have known all these details here. Okay. This is our basic pre tag, how we can work in this way. Now, you will see in many places, that you use this pre tag, and mostly it is used for codes. For example, if we write here, console.log, which is a very famous JavaScript concept. If we write hello, then notice here, then you can write all your codes here. And we can modify it with CSS later. At least, in our text, all the spaces that are there, all of them will be respected. All of them will be done here. So, see, it was not too difficult. And in just one of the videos, we covered all the important things that we have covered. In the next video, we will cover more tags in the same way. And the most important, documentation will be read. If you will subscribe, then, let's meet in the next video."
