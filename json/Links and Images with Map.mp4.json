    "text": " Welcome again to Chai or Code. We are continuing the series of HTML. In this video, we will learn about a little link tags, about A tag, and a little about images. Along with A tag, to know, I know, many of you know that there is an A tag, we add HRF, we add more underscore blanks in it, that's it. But it is a little more than that. You should know a little bit about history, how websites were created, how it is being made, and maybe there will be more changes in the future. After that, we will learn about images, not only about IMG tag, but about picture tag. We will go into more detail and see, how you need to know the good in-depth knowledge of HTML, so you may need CSS sometimes. Let's see a little detail in depth analysis. And of course, I have added an image here for you, whose name is HTMLCoursePNG, because we will see some details along with it. You can use any image, which is a little small, it is 400 by something, so it is easily loaded, that's why we are using it. Let's close the rest, and first of all, we know about anchor tag, let's study its details a little bit. So, what we do now, let's close this too, and make a new file, which is going to be simply link tags. Link tags, whatever you want to name it. HTML, exclimate tree, there we go, and we have a document here, so let's simply call it link tag, and what we do is, we simply open it, we will use command shift P, in live server, so that we can see the details in detail. Now, because we have come to know, how we can write some CSS, so let's do some CSS practice here. We entered the style tag, targeted the entire body, and then took background color from BGC, and we took 414141, so that at least something dark, not too bright, which will make the eyes look more visible. With this, we add colors, so that we don't have any problems with the colors. So, we have taken white color here, so now all our text will be white. Okay, we won't do the more complicated anchor tag, we will simply start reading about anchor tags. The syntax of anchor tags is very simple, first you write A, and then write colon here. Now, you will get to know the details, that you can get blank tags, link tags, mail, and telephone. This telephone works mostly, and it opens your website in browser. As soon as you tap, the browser automatically calls your API, which is the keypad API, and automatically the number is on your mobile, you can easily call. So, the website has a little usability. Similarly, there is a mail tag, if you enter here with the mail to, then the id you are mailing, your browser's default mail client will open, and your tool will automatically fill, and you can mail. So, you get some ease here. Similarly, you will see, as I write colon, there is a link here. This is not something special, it is just a shortcut of the emitter, because they know that many people write directly to Google, and here they write to Google, but what is the problem? Google is here, which is very problematic. Many people just write to Google.com, and forget to type HTTP. If they do this, then this link doesn't go anywhere. You will click, notice that it cannot go here, but when you go here, and type HTTP or HTTP S, then we save it again, so we open it again. Command Shift P, and open it on Live Server. So, when I click on Google, it redirects me to Google. Because this is the browser in default, so here its explanation is not so good, so what we will do for this, right click and open with Live Server. So, I open it on Live Server, it is very difficult, I can't recognize it, so it automatically takes me to Google. So, this is the basics of Google. Now, you will get a tag in it, which we will read on Stack Overflow, that too will be Target. So, as soon as you write Target, and after that, you get some options here, underscore blank, parent, self-top. You must have seen, either no option is filled, or blank option is filled. Whenever you write blank option, all our tags, are opened in a new tab. But do you know the problem, where does it come? When some people ask, what are the other tags actually? As soon as you take suggestions here, what is the difference between parent and self, or what is the difference between top? You can't recognize this difference, because the style we are coding now, our iframes and frame data usage is almost not the same. I would like to read an article here, because I know, you don't read much documentation, but a little documentation, will increase your knowledge. So, here is a very good article, which has been told in detail, how it happens. Now, here you will see, what is confusing is that, because generally, people don't write frames anymore. So, this frame, iframe, frame set, through it, the entire website was designed. You would click on some data, it would be loaded in a new frame, some data would be loaded in a new frame. So, there your elements, parent, top, all these would come there. Now, what is left is a self tag. So, this is a very good article, in which it is told in detail, how we used to write it, what is a frame, what is the frame inside the frame, what is the frame inside the frame, so what I do is, I give you the link of all the details, so that you can read it later. So, we will use the A tag here, this time I give you a blank, I don't write so many details, I just use the A tag here, and link to read, and here I give you the detail, its simply, oops, link, and here we have pasted it. Now, what we will do is, we will do the word wrap, so that we can see it well. Now, word wrap, along with the article, simply, this page is also where you have to read a small article, which is the link. So, that is it, we have this basics, and we have also known that we will use the underscore blank, or anything else, and we can have a lot of attributes, which we will read later, and one most important thing is, we have written a direct A tag, but it is not like that, you can wrap it up, if you want, for example, we have already seen, we will cut this whole, and if you want, you can wrap it up in H2, save it, and your H2. Some default, here, the styling automatically gives the link, but we can also change it to our CSS, which we will know in the CSS section. So, this was the simple thing about basics. Now, not only this, you can modify it through more images, tags, and through them, which is very easy. But, whenever you create links, you should know one more thing, that we will read one more topic in the coming time, IDs and classes. You can do a lot of things, on the same page, for example, I will do, here, we have written an A tag, after that, I will add a paragraph, in which we will add the word LORRIM, 400, there are many words. Save it, and see, there are many words in the page. Now, what I will do, I have to write something else, suppose I have to add one more paragraph, in which there is LORRIM, this time 200 words. Save it, and see, there are many things this time, we need a little more scrolling. So, bear with me, we will see a little more. We will take LORRIM again, and add 300 words more. Now, our page has started to scroll a little. Now, I want to keep a link here, and automatically, as soon as I put that link, I will reach on this page, or on this LORRIM, anywhere. So, it is very easy to do that, what can you do? If you want to see it better, if you want to see it more scrolling, then you can add one more paragraph tag. And in which we have LORRIM, and add 300 words again. You saw, because of the emits, we have made so many examples, that we have easy scrollable data. So, now I want to add a button here, first of all, we will add the button here, and I will shrink these paragraphs, so that I don't have to see the code. So, what I will do, I am not getting shrink indentation yet, but let's see more. I will add a button here, simply add an A tag, and the name of this A tag will be, scroll. Scroll. Now this A tag is not going anywhere, but what can you do? You can write here the hashtag, which is the short form of ID, and whatever you want to give name, like you want to give name, it is a section, so you gave name, section 2, you have to go to section 2. Now when you save it, you can't do anything through this scroll. Because there is no ID which is section 2. So, what you have to do is, simply you have to design a section 2 here. So, suppose section 2, I will give this last paragraph, or second last paragraph, as section 2, whatever paragraph you want. You don't have to do anything, you just have to give an ID, whose name will be section 2. Now, all the IDs can be referenced here, so ID denotes this, and section 2, we have given name, so this is our path. Now I will save it, now I go to scroll here, so automatically I am at section 2, which is the top of the page automatically. And there are many types of JavaScript plugins which you can scroll smoothly and do many things. But now you have understood how powerful A tags can be, you will definitely go and read about some history. So, this is our basic link tag. Now, I don't want to divide these videos into thousands of videos, so I will go a little in depth about images. Images are very easy, not complicated, but people read less about them, so it becomes a little complex. Exlimatory tab, I know you all have come to know about images. So, first of all, image tag. So, as you will write, IMG is a shortcut of the emits, you can see how many types of images we have. Not types, these are attributes of them. Simply source image, then with sizes, with source set, and then with index. So, we will see all this later. Let's see the basic image first. How it is done. Simply, you have to tell a source and then tell an all text. Now, why do I have to tell all text? Because if images are not loaded, then no image, let's save, right click and open with live server. So, as we go here, live server, then copy, this is opening on my second screen. Let's bring it here. So, if the image is not loaded, then we go here. Now, images are not that you simply go to Google and add any image here. If you add any image, then the copyright claim will come. You can do it, whether you like some code image, code laptop, or something like that. So, you will see that images you are not getting quality, and any of these images are used, means a good rule will come, you have copyrights. So, which images are to be used freely, which images are a very big multi-million market. You will see that many websites suggest Shutterstock, each image comes for $300-$500. You are learning in free tutorial, means not that everything is available in free. Images are a very big market, and every image has a value of $300-$500. But, it is not that everything is paid. Some people still give free images. Like, Unsplash is a website, where you can use high quality images for free, you can use them for commercial purposes. So, you can use any image you want, you don't need to give any credit. But, it will be good. There is another website, which is Pexels. Pexels has my account too. So, if you want, there are many people there too, who let you use your images for free, and no one is against it. You can use any image you want. You can use any image you like. You don't need to give credit, but it will be good. Suppose, I use this image, maybe it is a image of Japan. I will right click it, and notice, you don't need to copy image, you need to copy image address. Because, with this copy image address, you get an image, which you can load. As soon as I load this image, in the source, there is one way to load images. Now, I save it, I go back to my document, there is a lot of big image, it is loaded. With images, you will always see, that one property, two properties are always used, width and height. Most people use width, like I used 100 pixels. So, this image is small, of 100 pixels. And because, it is not white, so we will do the same thing, we will go in style, we will target the body, and we will write BGC, and you know the color, 414141, a shade of grey, so it is better. So, if you want, you can use image of 400 pixels, and it is still better. You can do a lot more with CSS, but these properties are common, width and height. Most people use width, but you can give height, but the problem is, if you don't know the ratio of height and width, then images get stretched, or it looks bad, so don't do this, please. Okay, so this is our basic images, how we can load images. If we have a local image, then what to do? No, duplicate it, and to duplicate it, Shift, Option, Alt key, and down arrow. So, this code is duplicate. Keep practicing these shortcuts, because when we go ahead, we will write fast-paced code in React, then I will make copies of lines and edit it, you can keep going. Now, we will load images with our local resource. So, in images, we will go to the root path and relative path, we will go to CSS more. Now, I will tell you the easiest way. What you do is, write dot slash. Dot slash means current folder. If you want to go back, then write dot slash. If you want to go ahead, then write the name of that folder. It is the easiest way. So, what we do here is, we have an image in dot slash, whose name is here, HTML. So, HTML course image. Now, there is a problem with this image. This image has spaces. And, the most useless thing in space, if you are taking your website to the server. This will work here. But, as soon as you go to the server, it will give you a lot of problems. So, the best thing will be, that you rename all your images, or single-word name, or dashes or underscore between them. So, I keep image, HTML course image here. Now, I will have to give the name of images again. And, I will write here, HTML course dot png. There is no difference. But, these small things, when your website goes to production, it will work properly or not. It depends on that. So, it was very basic. There is no such complex in images, till now. But, I will tell you in a little more detail, about what images can do for you. There are many examples and syntax in images. I would like to tell you in a little syntax. You must have seen one more element, which is not image, but picture. Now, when we have images, what is the need to use picture? Because, when you use picture tag, you have to use source tag too. You can use source media, media, media size, sizes, types. There are many types here. So, we use source. Now, you have used source. Source is a self-closing element. So, you can write like this. I save and go back. So, how do we add values in source? So, first of all, you write in source, SRC set. So, you load images from SRC set. So, I want to load the same HTML image. Now, I will give you a little detail in depth here. So, we have written this. Saved it. And saw, nothing is adding. So, where did it go? What is the need to use this image and picture? When you use tag like this, you have to use source. Along with this, you have to use IMG tag. When you use IMG tag, you can write same here and all tags. So, we save and go. Okay, now we have one more image. For some time, we will type in typic mistake in this image so that it doesn't load and we can see no image here. Okay. So, if we knew that we have to use IMG in picture tag, then why didn't we use it outside? Why do we need to use source here? It is necessary. You have many websites with such program or work like this where you have to load multiple images. It depends. If someone is opening on mobile or on big screen or on desktop, then what many people do here is that they detect before JavaScript which mobile is opening and which browser is opening. But you can do this work with CSS and HTML. As we have written source here, you can write one more attribute here which is media. You don't have to do anything in this media. Just write what is your media property. We will read more in detail in CSS but I would like to give you an example. As we have written here min width min width as we have written, suppose this is 650 pixels or you could have written whatever width you want here. So, when this width is there, then this image load can be duplicated. Do you remember the shortcut? Shift, Option and down arrow key. Now, you have written here suppose this is 460 pixels. So, here I am at the place of suppose 2 images, I want to load that. So, what will happen now? automatically as your browser will sink, based on that your images will load. Where I want which image? I don't have any image here, so that is not loading. Here is an image, so that is loading. So, it depends on what you want to do. On that basis, you can only use this source and source set. When this will not run, then by default your image will run. So, this is a simple difference when you go and read all of them. So, you know what we are going to do now? We are going to go simply. On Google, picture, html and mdn. We will go a little bit and study research. Actually, why does picture tag is used? Here we have multiple sources. We can read its try it, usage notes also a little bit. How can we use it in object position and where? Obviously, we have to read the attributes. And then we have to see examples. Here we can write and use the source set attribute. Through these attributes, there are many plugins which are earning lakhs of dollars. Only by manipulating this attribute we can optimize the images of websites. So, this is the basic image. Now, I believe the video is a little big but I think it is interesting. Now, I want to tell you one more thing because images are so powerful. In images, you might have seen on Instagram or Facebook that you can make face mask in images. For example, you can select where my friend is. I will tell you the details here. So, what we will do? First, we have to make a shape. So, we will go first on Google and we will search a small query here. Image Map Generator There are many websites which can generate images of the map. I will generate an image which I already have. I selected this image and opened it. Now, you can make many maps. Suppose, I click here and click here. So, this is my one map. Now, I will add one more area with it. I have to make it there too. You can make it yourself too. I will add one rectangle here that is for the HTML. This is the HTML map. Now, as soon as you will do the show code here to give the example of this code I will have to write a little JavaScript. Don't worry, I will not have to write much. I will have to write to explain. So, I will copy this code here and go back to my code editor. First, I will write a comment here. Which will be an image map generator. Let's comment it. And come here. Now, I have pasted it here. Okay, as soon as you will paste it the source of the image is HTML course image. Okay, but what we have to do is to load our own image. So, as soon as I save it and go to our document look, this image is loaded. For now, for some time I will make a mistake in this. So that these images are not loaded. And here, let's save it. I am loading an image somewhere else. Let's see where. Here, HTML course. Okay, we don't have to load this. And look. So, we have one image now which we know is coming from this particular code section. But what is the benefit of generating this map? And why is this code not visible to us? You won't see this code. This is for the target area. So that you have a website which has your images in it. So, what do you want to do when you click on that coordinate? What do you want to do when you click on it? So, this is the map of your images. So, how can we use this map? You can click on it now. But you will see carefully. So, as soon as you go to the face your cursor has become a hand clickable. It is not on the course yet. But as soon as I go to HTML it has become a hand clickable. Now, what is the benefit of this? On one image, you can do different work on the basis of where you are clicking on the user. Now, what do we have to do to do all this work? We have to write a small code. So, you don't have to learn this JavaScript. It is a small JavaScript. You will understand it after reading it. So, it is not that complex. So, what we will do is we can write the code of JavaScript. So, what are we doing here? We are making two functions of JavaScript. Now, what we do and what we do we will know all this in detail. But not now. We will write it as 1. And this is our function. This function has no special function. It will give us an alert message. And here we will write you clicked on 1. It is a simple function. Similarly, we will make another function. We will remember the shortcut again. We have duplicated it. And we have written here that we want 2. You clicked on 2. So, we have made this. You clicked on 2. So, we have two methods. We will alert you if you click on 1 or 2. Now, what we can do is which area, which zone, which map has our target clicked on. We can see that from here on click function. When we start JavaScript we will have more fun like this. But now, we will simply see on click function. So, we have simply added on click function and called 1. So, if you click on here, then run 1. And similarly, we copy it. And if you are targeting this area, then click on 2. So, we have written 2 here. And remember, we have to execute it because we have to run this function. We don't have to give reference. We will read this in more detail later. Now, when we click on here, then we click on 1. When we click here, then we click on 2. So, the meaning of saying is that if you have the in-depth knowledge of HTML and images and all these tags, then you can do many such things for which people use many JavaScript and you don't have to use it. So, for now, we will see this much. And be careful, don't think too much about this code. It was just to give you a demo. The important thing is that you can create maps and its coordinates. And similarly, Facebook tags friends in its images or tag your friends on Instagram. All these are the same. So, I think you all must have liked this video. If you did, then subscribe. See you in the next video."
